# DF-CoronaWipes
This is a silly modlet for Darkness Falls.

# Requirements
[Darkness Falls](https://gitlab.com/KhaineGB/darkness-falls-a20/-/tree/main). Obviously.

# Description
Among other things, this mod adds the titular CoronaWipes.  They're terrible.  A very low chance of working with a very weak effect when they do.  And they're not the worst cure for infections in this mod.  Desperate people in desperate times, right?

The very best thing this mod also adds are Twinkies.  They're a fairly rare in the apocalypse, but a luxury when you can find one.  Rumor is they can be a bit of a pick-me-up after a truly harrowing experience. 

# Installation
It's easy. Drop the 9-CoronaWipes folder into in your mods folder.
